# Robotic Arm Simulator

![Robotic Arm Interface](https://github.com/mmdeeb/RoboticARM/blob/main/images/image.png)

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a two-joint (RR) robotic arm simulator built with C# Windows Forms. The application graphically simulates the movement of a robotic arm to match the endpoint (the "hand" of the robotic arm) with a location selected by a mouse click within the application window.

## Features
- Simulation of a 2D robotic arm with two rotational joints (RR configuration).
- Real-time movement towards the target point clicked by the user.
- Display of arm joint angles necessary to reach the designated point.
- A user-friendly interface that provides a visual representation of the arm's position and orientation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Click anywhere within the right-hand side pane to move the arm's endpoint to that location.

## Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- .NET Framework
- Visual Studio (recommended for development)
